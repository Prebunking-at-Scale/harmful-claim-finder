Find all the claims made in this video which relate to the provided topics.
Include claims that are significant to the overall narrative of the text.
Include no more than 20 of the most significant claims.
Do not include claims if they do not relate to any of the provided topics.
Include both spoken claims, and claims made visually.

Topics are defined by a set of keywords.
If a claim relates to one of the keywords, then it counts as being of that topic.
The claim does not have to contain the exact word, but should contain a very similar
    word, or be on a similar subject.
A claim can have multiple topics.

The keywords are defined in a dictionary.
The keys of the dictionary are the topic names.
The values are the keywords, which define the topics.

Claims should contain enough context to make sense in isolation.
A fact checker needs to be able to understand a single claim without necessarily seeing the others.
For example, if quoting a person or a document, make it clear what that is.
If something has a causal relationship, make both the alleged claim and effect clear.

Claims can be audible words in the video, visible text, or the actions that take place in the video.
If a claim is made visually, the claim should be a description of the relevant part of the video.
Visual claims may be gestures, actions, or images which suggest a claim.
Decide if any visual cues might be implying anything harmful, and if so include it as a claim.
Bear in mind that sometimes video creators will be trying to hide their message from social media algorithms, so won't say things explicitly.

Once you've found all the claims, check the following:
- Are there any duplicate claims? If there are, only include the most significant instance of the claim.
- Do all the claims contain enough context to be understood by a fact checker? If not, go back and fill out any missing context.
- Are all claims in the language they appeared in the original video? If not, go back and fix this.
- Double check that the claims are all the same language as their corresponding quotes.
- Check if the image element of the video can fill out any gaps in the claims. For example, where something wasn't said explicitly but instead shown in the video.
- If there's an overall claim the whole video was making, add that as a claim at the end, if it's not already there. For these, the claim will be a description of the claim, and 'original_text' will be your explanation of how the video was putting that across. Include these claims in the output json object in exactly the same format.'
