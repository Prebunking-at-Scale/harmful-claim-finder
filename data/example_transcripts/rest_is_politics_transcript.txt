she seems to become much much tougher the government reported that arrested over almost 8,000 individuals seized 66 tons of drugs this is where she's trying to signal that she's taking a different

more welcome to the restus politics question time with me Rory Stewart and me an Campbell so where should we start we write this one Jonathan Diller Hunty there have been a number of times when you bemoan the lack of a coherent message from the left in opposition and also the global Trend in right-wing popularism I'd love to hear your thoughts on where you think Claudia shine bom and the marina party fit into this equation Al I I think Mexico is an amazing place to start because it echoes two things that we've been talking about a lot in the Pod firstly it's a really interesting counterbalance to Turkey um because it's an It's actually an economy very similar size to Turkey GDP per capita very similar size to Turkey and like turkey huge issues around migrants in very large number of Mexican migrants going to States large number of Turkish migrants going into Europe and in both cases different forms of populism but the second thing we're going to do later in the show of course is compare it to Canada which has also been the receiving end of Donald Trump and Mexico's responded in a very different way but anyway over to you on your views on shine bound um she's a very interesting woman she's a scientist by training and background so that's similar to Merkel and Thatcher um she was head of government of Mexico City she's a big environmentalist she she she worked on the en inter intergovernmental panel on on climate change it was very much a question of how was she going to get out of the shadow of Andres Manuel Lopez abdor amlo the her her predecessor as uh leader of Mexico she won the general election in a landslide since then she has a little bit like as you say Canada's had its politics defined by Trump to a certain extent so has Mexico since she took over she has handled it very differently and she is currently enjoying I checked the same level approval rating that Tony Blair was enjoying immediately after his handling of Princess Diana's death when it was up in the 80s um so she's got one of the amongst the highest ratings of any leader in the world right now and uh the obvious thing to say is well that must be because people think she's handled Trump quite well she has twice managed to saave off tariffs with personal interventions um she Praises him privately about his focus on immigration and drugs and so forth but she's not done anything big and public in terms of attack um but the other thing is that she's actually turned out to be a lot tougher on security than than amlo and I think this may be in part be driven by that she's got a very very tough message on crime and Law and Order um and then the other thing is that the social programs that she's doing they do appear to be starting to to bear fruit now lots of leaders get very very high ratings early in their presidency uh or their Premiership and then maybe start to fade but she is nobody can say she's not genuinely popular right now let's just just look at Mexico for a second so we drew the we we did a a long section on Turkey in in the last Pod episode and we talked about how turkey set off on its route towards populism Mexico is not as far along the Route as Adan but it's moved a long way we've got to acknowledge that she was very much a product of auor product of abor's party and aldor put her in this position and auor has taken Mexico a long long way away from its liberal Democratic Traditions um I know reasonably well a man called anesto zido who you may remember yeah was the president of Mexico and in fact actually one day we might want to interview if that was of interest and he represented a moment where if you go back to the '90s early 2000s Mexico looked like it was really on the journey to being the old Washington vision of a particular former liberal democracy and open free trade and joining NAFTA and all this kind of stuff alador took over and things began to change alador is a kind of classic populist he's somebody who has played some extraordinary games with Reinventing himself as a Mexican Nationalist speaking for the indigenous Community although he himself is actually as his name suggests from Spanish Roots big big changes one of them against the Judiciary terrible so he had been challenged by the judges particularly Supreme Court so he and Shane Bam Lenten the idea that the Judiciary in future will be elected that basically puts the executive his party in control of the Judiciary and even more worryingly potentially some of the criminal gangs in Mexico in charge of the Judiciary he's brought the Army very much under his control Alor gave a lot of businesses to the Army set up a new National Guard under the Army his he controls still the party which shamam is now the president of so so shamam very much seen as his creature being being used by abdor and then I guess the question is will she Break Free of him and if she breaks free of him is she going to reverse some of these Trends towards authoritarian populism or not how is she going to break free of aldor and then I guess the final thing which makes Mexico very very different to Turkey is that although both of them have these huge informal economies 40 50% of their economies are completely informal means they're not registered they're not paying tax and 10 12% of people working in agriculture but what Mex makes Mexico very different is that over the last 10 15 years the Mexican cartels took over control of the cocaine distribution in the United States from the Colombian gangs so the Mexican drug cartels became enormous the homicide rate in Mexico is astonishing there was a small reduction under oror but not a big reduction and extortion is through the roof so we've had Mexican companies closing 200 stores because of extortion we've had senior businessmen being killed looking into the way that she's dealing with crime and Drugs in particular I got the sense that that was the means by which she was trying to escape he became identified I don't know whether he actually ever said this but he became identified a bit like David Cameron's Huger hoodie um with this phrase hugs not bullets um and she seems to become much much tougher by her the end of her first 100 days in office they the government reported that arrested over almost 8,000 individuals seiz 66 tons of drugs so this is her this is where she's trying to signal that she's taking a different approach um and I think the other thing is just as just as Trump has transformed politics in Canada uh so I think because she has been seen as being under attack and handle that attack quite well um that that is probably the other factor that is making it look feel like a a very different sort of leadership I think we should say by the way Rory if any of her team are listening um we would love to have her on the podcast she's clearly a very very interesting um interesting modern leader fascinating thing as you say she is Jewish in a Catholic country she's a woman in quite a Mach show country uh she's quite a sort of intellectual and a strong populace tradition she's somebody who in many ways sounds technocratic but she's part of a government that hasn't only taken control of the Judiciary the Regulatory Agencies the military but a bit like turkey has basically taken control of the media you know 90% of the media now in Mexico is controlled by the government and and maybe we give populism in Mexico a bit more of a past because it's left-wing populism rather rightwing I you might have a point there Rory now here we are we had a lot of questions this week for reasons which will become obvious about young men uh inspired by and here's the question from Meg what are your thoughts on the show Essence um four-part series about a family whose lives are ripped apart when a young boy is arrested for uh allegedly killing a girl in his class have you watched all four yet Rory have you got to the end i' I've watched the first three out of the four right i' I'd love to know what you thought I mean I watched it with shash I first thing I just think artistically it was unbelievably good the acting was incredible also the courage of the director I mean the the third episode that I just watched is basically an entire episode where he's taken the confidence just putting you in a featureless room with two people talking to each other I think it's fabul I me I'm glad you said that actually because I think that the there's a danger sometimes with these things that you go straight to where you think the political debate has gone and Overlook the fact that the reason why it's been able to have that impact is because it is a brilliant piece of art and culture each episode follows one camera just sort of you know the way they do it it's almost like watching uh I guess it is a little bit like being in the theater but it's even more technically I think it's even more brilliant than that and then I think on the themes and of course this comes at a time where we just had Gareth Southgate the former England manager did the dimbleby lecture and it was really good actually very much on this theme as well about the role of young men how they see themselves the the the the extra pressures that they're under that maybe we didn't have growing up or even even my kids didn't have growing up and I think one of the things that comes through adolesence is how parents and teachers we like to think that we know what our kids are up to and the and the factors that are changing their lives but do we really know the impact that social media has had on them and is continuing to have on them uh and what it's what it's doing to them to their their self-esteem to their relationships and so forth so I I think it's brilliant television does Pack-a-Punch does carry a point um but I think it's part of the debate rather than the whole debate as it were but you obviously have a profound interest in State education in Britain I mean and what did Fiona think about that because of course it's a pretty terrifying portrait of non-functioning schools in Britain right yeah I me I mean a similar impression about the the sense of hopelessness of of the one of the teachers in particular who seemed very very nice but really didn't have much of a clue what was going on um I think Fiona sense is of of schools not the fictional adolescent school as it were but of the schools that she's involved in is that they do an amazing job in unbelievably difficult circumstances some of these broader social problems now mean that the job of teacher has changed fundamentally now there was always part of teaching that was the Pastoral that was the social work and and what have you but that is now much more a fundamental part of their life but but what I'm hearing from you is that you think that not many schools are that bad because that that portrait of a school um I don't think you really would think that you were giving people a decent education I mean there's a lot of lovely posters on the walls but the classroom management has collapsed so much that kids are not getting basic education then but I think yeah the two two well two things to say to that the first is it is a drama and the second is this is a this is a school in a drama on the day after one of the children has been murdered um so I it's not a documentary about the day in the life of an ordinary uh Northern England school um of course the other thing that came through that slightly went against that was how how smart they were you know they actually looked pretty smart and they were they were smart mentally um there was there was a vibrancy about those kids and I think that I guess what I was left with was was the sense of of hopelessness that that actually a kid that by you know if you if you saw the child and then if you saw the way the that he conducted himself Visa his parents and so forth you thought that's a that's a nice balanced child whereas it turns out no he's actually being kind of radicalized in this whole sort of incel thing going on although again back to the drama point I was the other person I S to this word who said they'd seen it who'd worked in schools and worked with a lot of child psychologists and said that you know she that she was she was too nicely dressed and she was she was sort of you know showing too much of her own emotion I think sometimes we've got to be careful with these dramas that we don't read so much into them that we start to treat them like like documentaries I think we should just appreciate it for a brilliant brilliant yeah well part story partly because it was so brilliant I mean I've never seen um any police movie take you through the sort of detailed procedures processes paperwork yeah checking a child in summoning the solicitor getting the blood samples taken um I thought that was all brilliant so an um your favorite subject Canada Freya how will the US trade war and Trump's rhetoric shape the Canadian election Morana wise Mark Carney calling election so soon and just a little plug before we get the alist answer um we've done some really great interviews recently with uh senior Canadian politicians including two separate interviews with Mark Cary the Canadian Prime Minister who's just called the election well I don't think anybody's surprised that this is what he did um in fact I think we said we said a couple of weeks ago that we didn't expect him to hang around long um he had nine days between winning the leadership election which made him prime minister he managed to fit in a visit to uh Paris to see macron to to the UK to see Kia starmer and your friend the king um which I think hopefully settled Canadians down a little bit as to where British hearts are in relation to this uh existential threat because I think that's how they feel I was at an event um last night and there was a a Canadian guy there and the reason I knew was Canadian was because he was wearing the the maple leaf on his lapel and I said do you always wear that he said no I've just worn it since the America since Trump started threatening Canada so the question how will the trade war and Trump's rhetoric shape the Canadian election it already has um it is the it is one of the Prime reasons why the liberal part part is back in the game having closed this 20 point plus Gap in the polls with the conservatives under Pierre poer it's one of the reasons I think why Mark Carney won the leadership election in such uh by such a big margin because people thought this guy's been around the block when it comes to the economy he's rolling the bank of England Bank of Canada uh in business he seems like he's a pretty tough guy um he's and I think then in relation to why he's calling it now because he's he's got momentum it still would be an remarkable comeback for the Liberals to turn this around I've been looking at a lot of Canadian newspapers in the last few days I mean some of them are very very biased against him um P ever has got quite a lot of media support I watched his um announcement calling the election framed it very much as looking after the economy looking after Canadians Canadian national pride standing up to America um has made no effort to have a conversation with Trump pever has I think shifted his agenda a bit but it's in the end I think America and Trump will be a big part of the campaign but it's interesting how in the last couple of days already you've seen a lot of the debate getting onto very conventional domestic election issues this tax that tax this education policy that education policy so I think it's going to be a curious mix of a very traditional election campaign with this remarkable backdrop of uh of trump and tariffs and poer presumably his campaign will try to be as domestic as possible and we'll try to focus on Trudeau's record and people being fed up with Trudeau and the Liberal Party they're trying to link Carney very much to the Trudeau story a bit harder to do that than if it had been Christian Freeland because of course chrisy Freeland was Trudeau's deputy and Finance Minister um so a lot harder I think Mark Carney can be the continuity where it's good and change where it's good that's how if I were him I'd be I'd be playing it he's also proving I mean he did a great social media clip lovely one with Mike Myers an extraordinary I mean you know incredible millions of views more than 30,000 likes last time I looked where he had a pretty pretty terrific comic timing including a good gag on what are the two seasons in Toronto and Mike Myers says winter and construction um anyway so I know I think good luck to him and and unlike um macron he's calling it at a time when he's in a reasonably good position in the polls and where he doesn't have that long to run anyway you not that much time to run it's not like maon who chose to to call an election when he was in a very bad position in the polls and potentially had another two years to go uh Gaza we had quite a lot of questions on Gaza this week probably in part because of the interview that we did with Franchesca albanesi which is the the interview that's up now on leading Lena can politicians say whether they believe Israel has broken international law yes or no I imagine that's provoked by David Lamy at one point saying they had and then the next Day saying they were at risk of having done so which looked like he'd been slightly brought into line by by number 10 and then Fatima from Birmingham why does the West talk about human rights but stay silent when Palestinians are killed you know we got so many comments on both sides of the argument on the back of doing that interview with Franchesca albanesi and I do think this is part of the problem so Fatima's question why does the West talk about human rights which the West does but stay silent now there are people in the west who stay silent but to say the West as a whole Stay Stay silent I think is overstates it and likewise I got some very very aggressive uh emails and texts and messages from people who would you would Define as either Israeli or Pro very pro-israel including some British politicians as well you know really quite aggressive you know you wouldn't if you did get Netanyahu I bet you wouldn't give him as an easy ride as you gave to her and blah blah blah well the answer is probably not because he's a serving prime minister whereas this is somebody that for most of our listeners we were probably introducing her to them uh could we have questioned her more on some of the things that she'd said maybe but I just think what it said to me what the reaction said to me is that those people who are broadly pro-israel listen to the interview determined to say that she was an anti-semite and those people who were broadly Pro Palestine anti-israel listened to the interview determined to say that she was a a saint and what we were trying to do just as we've done with other interviews for example when we interviewed your friend Uzi Arad ex- head of mosad the intelligence agency we had similarly people saying why are we so nice to him this is a guy who's done this this is a guy who's done that well answer because we're trying to have a conversation with him about who he is what he does what he thinks and why he thinks it and um I just think people should particularly people who bang on about Freedom as speech the whole time should maybe understand that sometimes letting people speak in their own terms rather than constantly being pushed around by an agenda is not the best way to get a decent debate very senior individual has um been writing that I'm anti-semitic and it's a you know was a really interesting piece in which he moves from talking about 14th century anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe and then smoothly goes from that to saying and another example of this is Rory Stuart how have you responded to that look first thing I think I can emphasize I mean he clearly feels very very strongly U what he's saying I don't think he's being insincere I think he feels that I'm anti-semitic I think he genuinely cannot understand why someone would think that what um Israel was doing in Gaza was unreasonable but I also think that he doesn't understand that I don't support what we did in Dresden I don't support uh what the United States did in many cases after 9/11 that I believe that international law applies to everybody and that even when you're defending yourself you have to act within international law and the rules of law in showing restraint and not doing uh what Israel is doing in Gaza you may be taking more risk it's possible that occasionally some terrorists are getting away or some guilty people are being spared but that is what international law is about that's what um we learned in Wars which is that you cannot simply say I have 100% right to security and the lives of other people don't matter if I'm fulfilling my security and that's that's true in domestic law that's true in international law and I I cannot accept that it's anti-semitic to say that or it's anti-semitic to support the international criminal court the international court of justice or to point out um the reality of what's happening in Gaza what about this then this this is from Ian Austin who a labor peer why did you allow her to use words like genocide or apartheid without any questioning at all why was she allowed to say that anyone in the human rights world who criticizes Israel is accused of anti-Semitism when people do that all the time and and so on so on and so forth so how do you respond to that on the L point I suppose the question is are people like in Austin comfortably saying they have no problem at all with people criticizing Israel for the Israeli government for breaking human rights do they have no problem at all with my criticizing them on their human rights record is he really saying that when you say that he doesn't come back and suggests it's anti-semitic she is an international lawyer uh she is talking about genocide she's talking about aparte she's quite careful in what she means by that and uh there is no doubt that uh maybe we can explain what she means by that but what's at the core of that is something that I'm afraid I observe every time I go to that region which is that Arab Israelis and Palestinians particularly in the West Bank and Gaza are not treated in the same way as Israeli citizens and Israeli settlers are favored in every single way in terms of government services in terms of security protection in creating illegal settlements in a Palestinian territory when Palestinians are not and I I can you know okay fine we can get in to Ian on what exactly he means or doesn't mean by AP partite but there is no doubt that they are treated to put it politely as second class citizens they do not have all the same rights and support from the Israeli government that Israelis have right last question um let's go domestic linnn Perry is the chief executive of bernardos she says we support thousands of children across the UK who 5 years on from the first lockdown continue to feel the impact of the pandemic School attendance declining Children's Mental Health in crisis over 4 million children growing up in pover poverty if this government is serious about wanting children born today to be the healthiest generation of children ever and about reducing child poverty there is serious work to be done if measures like scrapping the two child limit on benefits or extending the entire to free School meals are too expensive or can't be done for other reasons what steps can be taken to create a fairer future for children in the UK 4 million children growing up in poverty yeah well let me come come to you on that I don't understand how the government is going to do things for child poverty with its current economic policies I mean the the ways normally that you do things for child poverty are as the question is suggests you know we we know what the last Labor government would have done you you you redistribute you know you redistribute through a tax system you redistribute through more um generous welfare payments I mean fundamentally uh you make people less poor partly through uh giving them more financial support now you can talk about other things you can claim and I'm sure the government will that it's going to invest in education jobs apprentices but again where's the money coming from and I I cannot see a route if what the government is saying is we're going to not raise any taxes we're not going to borrow anymore we've got all these fiscal rules and we're going to cut government spending I don't see how that's going to lead to anything other than growing inequality in Britain and Growing Child poverty I'm I'm pretty confident on the current tracks that if we have this conversation in 2 three years time the situation will be worse under labor than it was under the conservatives unless I'm missing something well that is C I mean certainly for for I'm sure that bernardos um which is an organization that's dealing with some of the most challenged and and and children with difficult lives I read their their last report and you know to in in Britain in 2025 to see a passage that is about the rising rickets and we used to learn about rickets in in school when I was growing up as as an example of how diseases could be eradicated when you think that one of the the approaches that the government is taking is this thing about you know educating children in how to brush their teeth because we've got real problems of tooth decay or some of the issues we have with Child Nutrition you're talking about things that honestly in 2025 after the sort of prosperity that we have in enjoyed as a country over several decades it it's pretty damning for the country as a whole um and I I look I agree with you and when when you when you think that you know these welfare cuts and you know the government gave their explanation um and I agree that you know the more that people can work the better but you and I know and were you still an MP you'd be having them coming to your surgery there will be people who are about to lose benefits who have come to depend on those benefits and out of genuine need and at the same time time trying to raise a family and what have you at a time when you know we're worried about the birth rate and we're worried about where the jobs of the future going to come from now here's a lighter one Rory and I want to know whether this means anything to you at all Luke how did Tony Blair get to do that sketch with Katherine Tate now do you know what I'm talking about no it means absolutely literally nothing to me so explain that and let's finish off on that Jolly note with whoever Katherine Tate might be Tony Blair was the Prime Minister Katherine Tate a very very very famous comedian and she got Tony Blair to do a sketch with with her this is this is a Rednosed day anniversary story and she got Tony Blair to do a sketch with her where he delivered her most famous catchline which is I'm a bothered um but no that one was their idea and Tony was always up for stuff like that and he he delivered it like a pro I'm a bothered I'm not bothered are you bothered I'm not bothered lovely yeah yeah so you now know who Catherine t is RO thank you with that and let's let's finish on that see you soon
