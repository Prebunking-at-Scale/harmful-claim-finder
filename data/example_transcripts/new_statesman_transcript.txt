let's begin by turning our attention to the White House props department and that giant chart Trump used to reveal the so-called reciprocal tariffs the First Column was allegedly the tariffs imposed on the US 67% from China 39% from the EU 90% from Vietnam and so on where do these figures come from and are they in any way reliable I'm going to start at the end there no they're not in any way reliable um when that um poster was held up in the press conference last night I found myself going up to my television taking a photograph of the screen so I could look at the numbers in detail and just as an aside this is the first time I've ever tried to work out the global economic Outlook looking at a photo of my television I've taken on my phone that's that's sort of where we were we a strange world yeah those those numbers were really hard to understand now what the administration has spent the last two months saying they are doing is saying they're going to go around the world they're going to look at the tariffs and non-tariff barriers charged on us firms taking into account not just tariffs but product regulations and V rates and all this our hostility to chlorine washed chicken for instance would be treated as a tariff and they were going to come up with a number uh that that's what they told us they were going to do and I think that's pretty much what Donald Trump said they had done during the press conference it became apparent soon afterwards that is not what they've done what they've done is for every country in the world they've applied a really quite strange formula dividing imports from a country by total trade deficits with a country come up with a number said that's what we think the reciprocal tariff rate is and then charged half of it and you can see this if you look at the EU and the UK the UK is getting a 10% tariff the EU is getting 20 the EU and the UK charge essentially the same tariffs on the United States we call it vat yes yes um so it's you know these numbers I mean what you've basically got is you've got a 10% so-called Baseline tariff on pretty much all um Imports you've got some specifically higher tariffs on things like cars on things like steel and aluminium we already knew about and then you've got on top these sort of staggeringly high in some cases reciprocal tariffs countries like Vietnam China these are unbelievably High numbers and we for instance run a small trade deficit with the us we do we do so how can we be screwing them over in any way if they're if they're doing the same to us but more so yes exactly I mean you that this is because of the 10% minimum so no country has been charged less than 10% no matter what their their formula says I'm just sticking with this slightly sort of agonized heads scratching atmosphere for a moment how can it be that um we are any problem to the United States where if you look around you if you look around this room or any uh social gathering in in the UK they have so heavily interpenetrated our economy and our culture we carry American devices in our pockets um our smartphones we use American driven technology of all kind more and more controversial at the moment America is absolutely wrapping itself around us absolutely and you know it's important to say you know these numbers Donald Trump was talking about were only about the goods trade and America does run a deficit in Goods but it is a big service exporter which are not counted in these numbers but you're right you know you step back Donald Trump last night said for decades other countries have been pillaging and raping the American economy and American consumers but this isn't e which has performed outstandingly well relative to other rich countries um it's pretty clear that Donald Trump has been an Enthusiast for tariffs from an early age and indeed I was talking to somebody who used to work with him Fiona Hill in the first Administration even back then he described himself as tariff man he used to say I'm tariff man and he has this kind of uh gold tinted uh view of America the Golden Age the period when America because America used to have pretty high tariffs didn't in the 19th Cur had very high tariffs late 19th early 20th century yes and Trump looks back on that as the good old days he does he does back to sort of the 1890s um President Taft President McKinley early 20th century High tariff strong America is how he sees it okay isn't he a bit right in the sense that was when America started to build up her industrial capacity in a serious way to challenge Germany to challenge Japan to challenge the British Empire as it then was and therefore in a sense that period of a high tariff wall worked for America well this is certainly the Donald Trump argument that America was growing the fastest relative to other countries when tariffs were high now I think there's two sort of problems of that firstly the work of economic historians who've gone backed and looked at the numbers I think there were all sorts of reasons why the American economy was growing so fast in the late 19th century you know a surplus of land Rising population and they think tariffs were actually probably a drag your growth would have been even faster without them but even even if that's wrong you know global trade in the 2020s is very different to global trade in the 1880s 1890s components crossers be moth squatting over most of the world economy not China but everywhere else yes we're in a very different world so how much do you think that the drama of what we've seen this week is really driven by Donald Trump's Envy of and fear of China I think there's certainly a lot of that you know China I mean the Tariff charged on Chinese Imports is going to be above 50% now that is a huge huge number I think it is partially driven by this um this fear that America is falling behind I think Donald Trump's logic I think you know I think Donald Trump and the people around him accept that tariffs sudden the sudden imposition of these new taxes on Imports at these high levels is going to cause economic disruption there's no way it can't he would argue in four five years time maybe it been Donald Trump he say 6 12 months but in four five years time okay to avoid these tariffs there will be more Manufacturing in the United States that's certain the JD Vans view re you know resore American manufacturing bring the smoking chimneys back to the Rust Belt yes it is but you've really got to question in some of this so you know take take a really basic Goods take um t-shirts or trainers you know there's going a huge tariff on Vietnam now 50% of the trainers Nike sell in the US so made in Vietnam they're going to become a lot more expensive because of these tariffs it's worth asking yourself why does the administration want to bring t-shirt manufacturing back to the United States because that's the logic of their argument they're being ripped off by buying T-shirts from abroad you can make t-shirts in America they'll be a bit more expensive but it's not just that it'll mean more expensive t-shirts for consumers which is not a good thing it's that you're going to have to deploy economic resources into t-shirt manufacturing we're going straight back to Adam Smith here I think we absolutely are quote from Donald Trump the tariffs will not be fully reciprocal I could have done that yes but it would have been tough for a lot of countries now most have being charged approximately half of what they charge the US he says do you think that is a coded way of accepting that his own figures are dodgy I think I think it definitely is and and you know I mean the average tariff the EU charges on American Imports tariff not non-tariff barriers is around 2 and a half 3% he's gone to 20 and describing this as a kind measured action let us be parochial and talk a bit of about Britain we are getting a 10% Baseline tariff rate compared to 20% in the EU is that good news for us I mean it's relatively good news the emphasis on the relative here and I think we should be careful with that 10% number because it's a 10% tariff on the UK but on steel and aluminium it's 25% we export quite a bit of Steel to America and on automobiles it's 25% and we export quite a few cars to America so the nightmare faced by the luxury car makers like Bentley and Aston Martin and uh Land Rover and so forth that remain that is a nightmare yeah and that's going to cost jobs in the UK it is and and those tariffs are now in force the automobile TOS went into Force last night apart from steel apart from Cars what are the other sectors most affected so Pharmaceuticals is the ever really big one um exporting to um America and you know so yes Britain um Britain has got away with a lower tariff than the EU or than Japan and that is a relative you know relative win for the UK on the other hand when we're looking at the impact of these tariffs on the UK there's they come in sort of two rounds there's the direct impact and the direct impact on us on the the tariffs charged on our export is a bit lower than it could have been but there's also this huge second round effect there's disruption of the global trading system there's going to be a big hit to the European Union which is our most important trading partner and I think the indirect impact the second round effects going to be a much bigger deal for the British economy than the first Trend now not surprisingly Downing Street has reacted with relief and a slight Pat of itself on the back over all of this you know the strategy of keeping calm staying close to Donald Trump being nice to him giving him the state visit Etc that seems to have worked they're saying but of course an awful lot depends upon what kind of trade deal they can then negotiate with Trump in the weeks and months ahead what's your understanding of The Upside and downside of what they're trying to do when on one level the upside for the UK is getting tariffs back to zero we from 10% so sort of The Upside is getting back to where we were last week you know side is back to where we were at the start start of January it's not you know a new win U on top of that it's going back to the start what will the US want in return is the question I mean they almost certainly are going to go for the Digital Services tax that the UK's introduced on big Tech firms they're talking they don't seem to like the Online safety bill because of how it affects American firms it's lots of little changes they might want this is this is the really big political question to me which is how much does the in the US use the Tariff weapon to interfere in our domestic life and our domestic politics because you know the digital service tax is a fair tax it's a reasonable tax um British consumers attitudes to hormone treated beef or chlorine washed chicken might be scientifically irrational or they might be rational but they're certainly deeply rooted it's part of who we are we had the state department intervening in the case of a woman who held up a sign outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in other words on the culture War side they are pushing very very hard and they're coming comes a point when you say if all of that is the case and if we're going to lose steel jobs and if we're going to lose automobile jobs and if we're going to lose whiskey jobs is it really worth it yeah I think that's the question I think you know it's not just the question for Britain you know I think the way to think about these tariffs I think that is helpful is there is now this 10% Baseline and I think he's going to struggle to go below that 10% Baseline um but you know in the case of the EU or Japan he might be prepar to say look you're at 20% or you're at 24 I'm prepared to come down towards 10 if you give me these the these wins and I think you know it's a transaction I mean the problem is this is a very very hard Administration to deal with they are transactional but they're not just transactional they're uncertain so if you make a deal today who knows what happens in six months time so Duncan let me put to you in those in that case the alternative idea which was something the liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey and many more have been saying which is Let's Pretend the United States doesn't exist let's turn our backs on them and create our own new freed trade area involving Australia Canada the EU and other countries what is the economic outlook for something like that even if even if it could be done politically which I don't think it could be I mean you know the US is not a huge market for Britain it's an important market for services for goods it's about 60 or 70 billion pounds that is significant and these tariffs are going to hurt and cost jobs um you know I I agree with the the general principle that no matter whether or not countries are retaliating against the United States it is important that countries keep trading with each other and I think that's the big so you know there was a lot of talk yesterday this is the biggest increase in US tariffs since the early 1930s since the smooth holy tariffs that some people blame on the the Great Depression the difference is in the 1930s the US whacked up its tariff level and so did other countries at the same time against each other that's the sort of spiral that's got to be avoided now so this is very interesting would it be possible I wonder and this might be politically possible in this situation for the EU to cut tariff and non-tariff barriers to the UK but also to Canada to Australia and to other countries I mean it's certainly possible it's certainly possible politically politically it's very difficult I think but it's certainly possible I mean this debate on retaliation against America is an interesting one because you know instinctively when you're hit by tariffs what the public want is you to be responding to be retaliating now you tariffs hurt your own country these tariffs are going to hurt America they're going to make Goods more expensive for American firms and American consumers retaliating hurts your own economy if we retaliate against America with tariffs we are making American Goods more expensive for British ping ourselves in the face really so far how have the markets been reacting to the TR the Trump tariff news not very well is is the short answer if you were watching US futures the US markets were closed when Donald Trump did his press conference last night if you were watching the Futures Market it just goes down in a straight line when he starts talking about the actual tariff numbers rough very rough in Asian markets overnight and this morning European stock markets British stock market down one and a half 2% um so you know markets are not at all happy as you might expect with these these but it's not a venous plunge so far it's not a venous plunge no because I think there's still I mean it's fascinating okay so for the last for the second half of 2024 Wall Street was obsessed with what it called its Trump trade the idea that Donald Trump if elected was basically going to do everything they liked deregulation low taxes and be quite restrained on the stuff they weren't so keenon and this would mean the dollar would be soaring US Stocks would be rising that hasn't really played out he's not done very much in terms of deregulation and tax cuts he's done an awful lot in terms of tariffs but still there is this sense that surely he can't really mean it that he's going to pull back that's that's how markets are still playing this the they're upset they're nervous they're starting to price in the real chance of recession but they still don't really believe there's going to be a 50% plus tariff on China and yet we have these grandiose Trump promises still in front of us from the point of view of American voters he's going to raise so much revenue from tariffs that he's going to cut slash or even abolish other forms of Taxation and at the same time he's going to create new Industries right across America is it economically possible to do both no it's not I mean this is the problem he um it's not and slightly wonky point but an important one in the last day the US dollar has been weakening now almost every forecast of what would happen under these tariffs assumed the dollar would strengthen they assumed America would put in place tariffs it would do less trade there'd be less Imports and the dollar would rise and the rising value of the dollar would slightly offset the impact of some of these tariffs now what's actually happened is he's gone for a tariff policy so large so much larger than the markets expected they've been rattled and the dollar is falling if you have these tariffs and a falling dollar rather than a Rising one the hit to American consumers is higher inflation Rises faster and the Federal Reserve the American Central Bank is left in this awful position of the economy is slowing and disrupted but because price growth is high they can't cut interest rates so you know it may be because he's done a lot more than the markets were expecting he's made the tradeoff in the US economy a lot worse in the short run and he's going to make the politics much harder in the short run uh in the US economy as well perhaps but you raised there something Duncan absolutely fascinates me which is the status of the dollar you know as the world's Reserve currency do you think that is no under threat I do and you know saying that okay might like an easy thing to say but saying that would have sounded completely crazy at any point in the last 15 20 30 years but it's it's not and it's not just me saying it you've got serious players in the markets you've got you know Deutsche Bank um have started speculating is the safe haven value of the dollar under threat this is all something radically new and the dollar you we talk about a Global Financial system it's really a dollar system which everyone else um plays in um if the if the reserve value of the dollar is under threat if when central banks around the world and Sovereign wealth funds are looking where do we want to hold our our you ultimate safe reserves if they're thinking maybe it's not the dollar that is a big big change in the global system and also leads to the immediate question where is it then is it the rimi I mean it's your better bet is probably the Euro it's probably the Euro it's it's a um in that the rimi is you know the currency of China 20 25% of global GDP but um Capital markets are quite closed it's hard to move it around whereas the euro is a freely floating Curren freely movable currency and this is a slightly more AB ract thought but if the dollar ceases to be the world's Reserve currency isn't that an enormous blow to American Prestige and soft power around the world as well it's a major blow to American Prestige and soft power and it's a major blow to American hard power the ability to enforce economic sanctions and financial sanctions around the world relies on them controlling the dollar if the dollar is no longer the reserve currency US sanct Financial sanctions become less powerful and the dollar being the world's Reserve currency means the U us has been able to borrow pretty much as much um as much as it wants at reasonably low interest rates because people need dollars if the dollar is no longer the single Global Reserve currency then presumably us borrowing costs start to rise as well this all started from American domestic politics but before we get too apocalyptic American domestic politics might sort it out as well and we've got midterm elections coming everyone in America can read the polls and hear what's being said at town hall meeting so we we'll watch for that one slightly strange Element last night however Duncan no tariffs for Russia no terrs of Russia now the the argument from the United States trade representative is that Russia is subject to sanctions so there is no trade with Russia so Russia and Belarus were missed off now in reality there is a bit of trade that five billion worth and in your judgment is there any rigal room in all of this I mean we've been talking as if it's a done deal it sounded like very much a done deal this is a a day in America because history there won't be it will be remembered for centuries and all the rest of it um that's it world you you now know what I think says Mr tff Man but is there room for further negotiation in all of this I mean there probably is I mean I I I think Donald Trump is going to not want to go below this 10% and you know before before Liberation day if we're calling it that average US tariffs were about 2 and a half% so you know and as of this morning the average is about 24% so it's 10 times as high as it was I think there may be wiggle room to go back down to 10 or 15 but we'll see the problem he's got though is he wants the revenue from these tariffs to pay for tax cuts and he s of wants it both ways he says that the tariffs are going to keep out Imports but also raise a lot of money and they will do one or the other uh we can just about both remember the OPEC price shock uh we can remember the pandemic of course we can remember the financial crash is this the single biggest political the economic moment for the world since the second world war it is certain certainly the biggest economic moment for the global economy since the second world war that has been done by choice so you know the pandemic Bolt from the blue financial crisis Doom crash these sorts of things were big economic shocks this is the first economic shock yes
